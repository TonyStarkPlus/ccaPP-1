Changes in ccaPP version 0.2.0

    + Functions ccaGrid() and ccaProj() now force consistency of the Spearman, 
      Kendall and quadrant correlation.
    
    + New functions maxCorGrid() and maxCorProj() for maximum correlation, 
      which retain the argument for consistency of the Spearman, Kendall and 
      quadrant correlation.
    
    + permTest(): now using the new functions maxCorGrid() and maxCorProj() 
      rather than ccaGrid() and ccaProj().
    
    + permTest(): argument 'cl' is now preferred over argument 'ncores' for 
      parallel computing.
    
    + Added fallback mode for robust standardization if the MAD of a variable 
      is zero.
    
    + Bugfix in ccaGrid() and its wrapper CCAgrid: seed for the random number 
      generator is no longer ignored.
    
    + Bugfix in CCAproj(): now correctly wrapped around ccaProj().



Changes in ccaPP version 0.1.1

    + Using package parallel now to detect the number of available processor 
      cores rather than OpenMP.
    
    + Internally created parallel cluster in permTest() is now stopped via 
      on.exit().
    
    + Bugfix in permTest(): random number streams for parallel clusters 
      supplied by the user are only reset if a seed is supplied.
