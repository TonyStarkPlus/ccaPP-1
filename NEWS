Changes in ccaPP version 0.1.1

    + Using package parallel now to detect the number of available processor 
      cores rather than OpenMP.
    
    + Internally created parallel cluster in permTest() is now stopped via 
      on.exit().
    
    + Bugfix in permTest(): random number streams for parallel clusters 
      supplied by the user are only reset if a seed is supplied.
